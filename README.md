It was a test task for a hungarian tech company. I applied for frontend developer role and succeeded to get that position with this little project. I got a better offer from another company though so I never worked for them.

This is a simple showcase of a Vue js + Vuetify project setup with vue-router and Vuex.

```
## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
